2.	Model Training

Basic Model 
•	Importing all model from libraries
 
•	Method for confusion matrix
 
•	Reading data
 

o	Logistic Regression
The logistic regression classifier is applied to the preprocessed data. The training time and accuracy rate are calculated using the training set. The trained model is then used to predict the target variable for the testing set. The confusion matrix is generated, and the accuracy rate is calculated based on the predicted and actual values.
 


o	Random Forest Classification
The random forest classifier is employed to classify the data. Similar to logistic regression, the training time and accuracy rate are calculated. The model is used to predict the target variable for the testing set, and the accuracy rate is determined using the confusion matrix.
 

o	Decision Tree Classifier
The decision tree classifier is utilized for classification purposes. The training time and accuracy rate are computed, and the model is used to predict the target variable for the testing set. The accuracy rate is calculated based on the confusion matrix.


o	Naive Bayes Classifier
The naive Bayes classifier is applied to the preprocessed data. The training time and accuracy rate are determined, and the model is used to predict the target variable for the testing set. The accuracy rate is calculated using the confusion matrix.
 
o	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
The KNN classifier is employed to classify the data. The training time and accuracy rate are computed, and the model is used to predict the target variable for the testing set. The accuracy rate is calculated based on the confusion matrix.

o	Results and Analysis
After applying the various classifiers to the dataset, the accuracy rates and training times are collected and analyzed. The results show the performance of each classifier in detecting RPL attacks. Based on the accuracy rates, it can be observed that the Decision tree achieved the highest accuracy rate, followed by logistic regression.
